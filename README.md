# Predicting Credit Risk in Peer-to-Peer Lending
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending provides borrowers with relatively low borrowing interest rates and gives lenders a channel for investment on an online platform. Since most P2P lending does not require any guarantees, the overdue payment of borrowers results in a massive loss of lending platforms and lenders. Many risk prediction models are proposed to predict credit risk. However, these works build models with more than 50 features, which causes a lot of computation time. Besides, most P2P lending datasets are much more than the number of nondefault data. These researches ignore the data imbalance issue, leading to inaccurate predictions. Therefore, this study proposes a credit risk prediction system (CRPS) for P2P lending to solve data imbalance issues and only require few features to build the models. We implement a data preprocessing module, a feature selection module, a data synthesis module, and five risk prediction models in CRPS. In experiments, we evaluate CRPS based on the de-identified personal loan dataset of the LendingClub platform. The accuracy of the CRPS can achieve 99%, the recall reaches 0.95, and the F1-Score is 0.97. CRPS can accurately predict credit risk with less than 10 features and tackle data imbalance issues.
「P2P借貸之風險預測系統」透過分析借款人的各項借貸相關資料，評估借貸交易是否可能有逾期的情況發生，並在建置模型時解決資料不平衡的問題，提升模型準確度。本計畫完成一項提供給放款人P2P借貸信用違約的風險評估系統，違約預測準確率達99%，並將F1-Score提升至0.97，有效控制借貸違約率及降低借款人的違約風險，亦減少借貸平台因為違約而要向放款人賠償的成本支出，提供一個可信賴的風險控制指標。
